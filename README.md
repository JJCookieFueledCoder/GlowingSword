# GlowingSword
A Glowing sword project I did during the summer of 2024(unfinished) and protyped in 2023

This is includes the code I made for the project. Which controls the LEDS of the sword to produce different patterns
This also contains the STL Files for parts that will be 3D printed.

The Proto-Type was made of wood and acrylic and was roughly 2m long.
I improved the design by making the blade thinner to reduce weight and also made non of the parts out of wood. For the handle I used a PVC pipe as it is durable and lightweight.
For both swords I used an arduino nano since it had enough RAM for the lights and it was small so I could fit it into the handle. The prototype had the characters cut into wood and resin filled however the second version will have the characters covered while painting so the light shines through for them.
